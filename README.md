## Founder Journey – Chandan Mahato, Jobcode

👨‍🎓 I pursued my BCA from a semi-government college and later decided to go for an MCA to improve my chances of landing a better job. After clearing the entrance exam, I took admission into the MCA program with a clear goal—to enhance my skills and secure a good job with a decent salary.

⚠️ However, as I neared the completion of my master’s degree, I realized our university had almost zero placement opportunities. Due to the low number of students and internal college politics, companies didn’t visit our campus. So, I began applying for off-campus opportunities.

💡 Although I had strong practical skills, my academic scores weren’t impressive. From the beginning, I was more interested in real-world projects and hands-on learning. By my 3rd semester, I had already built a fully functional mobile app and added features to my university’s website.

📚 Despite facing multiple rejections, I kept learning:
- How to write a strong resume ✍️  
- How to approach HRs professionally 💼  
- How to write cold emails 📧  
- How to find genuine job opportunities 🔍  
- How to apply for pooled campus drives 🎯  

Being from a Tier 3 college, the journey was tough—but every rejection taught me something valuable.

✅ Eventually, I received two job offers. But then, I realized something bigger—there are thousands of students just like me. They have the **skills**, but lack **guidance** and access to **real opportunities**. Many fall into scams due to a lack of awareness.

## That’s why I created [Jobcode.in](https://jobcode.in)

A platform where skilled students can:
- 🔹 Find **verified job opportunities**
- 🔹 Access **internships**
- 🔹 Get curated **career resources** — all in one place.

📈 In just 2 months, we’ve seen massive growth:
- 🧑‍💻 **1.5K+ LinkedIn followers**
- 💬 **4K+ WhatsApp group members**

From just 120 followers in month one—mostly from our own college—to students from across 🇮🇳 India now joining our mission. The growth is **compound and organic**.

## What We're Building

We’re now developing a full-fledged platform with features like:
- 🤖 **AI-based resume review**
- 🧾 **Resume-building guidance**
- 🔎 **Skill-based job matching**
- 🌟 A curated list of **underrated but great companies**

We’ve formed a small but passionate team of college friends to build this. But as students, we lack the funds to fully launch and scale. Yet—we already have users, and we’re growing fast!

## Why Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub?

We believe Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub can help us:
- ⚙️ Build reliable infrastructure
- 📡 Scale rapidly
